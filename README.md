A comprehensive suite of tools for analyzing C/C++ build dependencies, identifying rebuild bottlenecks, and optimizing compilation times in large projects using Ninja build system.

## 🎯 What Does BuildCheck Do?

BuildCheck helps you answer critical questions about your C/C++ build:

- 💡 **"What will rebuild if I change this header?"** → See exact impact before committing
- 🔍 **"Why is my build so slow?"** → Identify dependency bottlenecks and high-cost headers
- 🏗️ **"Is my architecture healthy?"** → Detect cycles, god objects, and coupling issues
- 🚀 **"How can I optimize build times?"** → Get actionable refactoring recommendations with ROI estimates
- 📊 **"What changed and why is it rebuilding?"** → Understand rebuild reasons and root causes

### 1. Basic Rebuild Analysis

```bash
# See what will rebuild and why
./buildCheckSummary.py ../build/release/

# Get detailed file list
./buildCheckSummary.py ../build/release/ --detailed

# Export as JSON for CI/CD
./buildCheckSummary.py ../build/release/ --format json --output report.json
```

**Example Output:**
```
=== Rebuild Summary ===
Rebuilt files: 47

Reasons:
   35  → input source changed
   12  → output missing

Root Causes:
  include/core/Types.hpp → triggered 18 rebuilds
  include/utils/Logger.hpp → triggered 12 rebuilds
```

### 2. Architecture Quality Check

```bash
# Analyze architecture with DSM matrix
./buildCheckDSM.py ../build/release/

# Get proactive improvement suggestions
./buildCheckDSM.py ../build/release/ --suggest-improvements

# Focus on circular dependencies
./buildCheckDSM.py ../build/release/ --cycles-only
```

**Example Output:**
```
=== Improvement Candidates (Ranked by ROI) ===

🔴 CRITICAL (ROI: 85.2)
  Header: include/core/GodObject.hpp
  Issues: God Object (fan-out: 45), Cycle Participant, Coupling Outlier
  Impact: Would reduce rebuild time by ~23% (156 → 120 files)
  Effort: Medium (2-3 weeks)
  Break-even: ~8 commits
```

### 3. Git Commit Impact Analysis

```bash
# Estimate impact of uncommitted changes
./buildCheckRippleEffect.py ../build/release/

# Analyze specific commit
./buildCheckRippleEffect.py ../build/release/ --commit abc123f

```

**Example Output:**
```
=== Git Ripple Effect Analysis ===

Changed Headers (2):
  • include/core/Types.hpp → affects 156 source files
  • include/utils/Logger.hpp → affects 89 source files

Summary:
  Total affected sources: 245
  Rebuild percentage: 12.3% (245/2000)
  Impact: MODERATE (10-30% rebuild)
```

### 4. Find Dependency Bottlenecks

```bash
# Comprehensive transitive dependency analysis
./buildCheckDependencyHell.py ../build/release/

# Show top 20 problematic headers

# Quick analysis (skip expensive operations)
./buildCheckOptimize.py ../build/release/ --quick

# Generate optimization report
./buildCheckOptimize.py ../build/release/ --report optimization_plan.txt
```

## 📚 Core Tools Deep Dive

### buildCheckSummary

**Purpose:** Quickly analyze what files would rebuild and identify root causes.

**Key Features:**
- Runs `ninja -n -d explain` to detect rebuild reasons
- Categorizes reasons (input changed, output missing, command line changed, etc.)
- Identifies root cause headers triggering cascading rebuilds
- Multiple output formats (text, JSON)
- No external dependencies beyond Ninja

**Use Cases:**
- Daily development: "What changed and why?"
- Pre-commit checks: "Is this rebuild reasonable?"
- CI/CD reporting: Export JSON for build dashboards

**Documentation:** [README_buildCheckSummary.md](README_buildCheckSummary.md)

### buildCheckDSM

**Purpose:** Comprehensive architecture analysis using Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM) methodology.

**Key Features:**
- **Matrix Visualization:** Visual DSM showing all header dependencies
- **Cycle Detection:** Identifies circular dependencies with minimum feedback set
- **Layered Architecture:** Computes dependency layers and validates architecture
- **Coupling Metrics:** Fan-in, fan-out, stability, PageRank centrality
- **Proactive Analysis:** `--suggest-improvements` recommends high-ROI refactorings
- **Differential Analysis:** Compare architectures across builds/commits
- **Statistical Analysis:** Coupling distribution, outlier detection (uses NumPy)

**Anti-Pattern Detection:**
- God Objects (high fan-out)
- Circular Dependencies
- Coupling Outliers (statistical analysis)
- Unstable Interfaces (low stability score)
- Hub Nodes (architectural bottlenecks)

**Header Classification by Architectural Role:**

BuildCheckDSM categorizes headers based on their fan-in/fan-out patterns to distinguish between healthy architectural patterns and problematic anti-patterns:

| Classification | Pattern | Indicators | Assessment | Example |
|---------------|---------|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Foundation Headers** | High fan-in<br/>Low fan-out | 30+ dependents<br/>< 10 dependencies<br/>Stability: 0.00-0.10 | ✅ **GOOD**<br/>Stable base, high reuse | `BasicTypes.hpp`<br/>`Vector2.hpp` |
| **God Objects** | High fan-out<br/>Low fan-in | 30+ dependencies<br/>< 10 dependents<br/>Stability: 0.90-1.00 | ❌ **BAD**<br/>Knows too much, needs splitting | `Manager.hpp` with many includes |
| **Middleman Headers** | High fan-in<br/>High fan-out | 15+ dependents<br/>15+ dependencies<br/>Stability: 0.40-0.60 | ⚠️ **PROBLEMATIC**<br/>Coupling bottleneck | `BaseWindow.hpp` acting as broker |
| **Leaf/Client Headers** | Low fan-in<br/>Low fan-out | < 15 dependents<br/>< 15 dependencies<br/>Stability: varies | ✓ **NEUTRAL**<br/>Isolated component | Application-specific files |

**Stability Score Interpretation:**
- **0.00-0.10** = Highly stable (foundation, rarely changes)
- **0.40-0.60** = Medium stability (middleman, coupling point)
- **0.90-1.00** = Highly unstable (god object, frequently changes)

**Note:** Foundation headers are listed in `--verbose` mode only, as they represent healthy architecture and don't require action.

**ROI Calculation:**
- Estimates rebuild time savings
- Calculates break-even point (commits until payback)
- Prioritizes by severity: 🟢 Quick Wins, 🔴 Critical, 🟡 Moderate

**Use Cases:**
- Architecture reviews and technical debt assessment
- Proactive refactoring planning with cost/benefit analysis
- Tracking architectural quality over time
- Validating layered architecture compliance

**Documentation:** [README_buildCheckDSM.md](README_buildCheckDSM.md)

See [TEST_SUITE_SUMMARY.md](TEST_SUITE_SUMMARY.md) for details.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### ccache Compatibility

If using ccache and encountering errors like `error: no such file or directory: 'sloppiness=...'`:

BuildCheck automatically sanitizes ccache-related arguments from compile_commands.json. If issues persist:

1. Ensure you're using Clang 18+
2. Check that compile_commands.json is properly generated
3. See detailed troubleshooting in [README_buildCheckDSM.md](README_buildCheckDSM.md#troubleshooting)

### Large Projects

For very large codebases (>10,000 files):

- Use `--filter` to focus on specific directories
- Consider `--quick` mode in buildCheckOptimize
- Use `--top N` to limit output in various tools
- Run analysis on module subsets

### Performance Tips

- **Parallel Analysis:** Most tools using clang-scan-deps run in parallel (use all CPU cores)
- **Caching:** Results are cached where possible; delete `.buildcheck_cache/` to force refresh
- **Incremental Analysis:** Use differential mode (`--compare-with`) to analyze only changes
