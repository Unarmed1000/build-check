# BuildCheck Tools

A comprehensive suite of production-ready tools for analyzing C/C++ build dependencies, identifying rebuild bottlenecks, and optimizing compilation times in large projects.

## 📋 Overview

BuildCheck provides nine complementary tools that help you understand and optimize your C/C++ build process. Each tool focuses on a specific aspect of dependency analysis, from quick rebuild impact checks to comprehensive dependency hell detection and architectural structure analysis.

## 📦 Requirements

### System Requirements
- **Python 3.8+** (required)
- **ninja** build system (for most tools)
- **clang-scan-deps** (optional, for source-level dependency analysis)

### Python Packages
Install all required packages with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Required packages:**
- `packaging>=24.0` - Version checking utilities
- `networkx>=2.8.8` - Graph analysis and cycle detection
- `GitPython>=3.1.40` - Git operations (for buildCheckRippleEffect)

**Optional packages:**
- `colorama>=0.4.6` - Colored terminal output (graceful fallback if missing)

### Verify Installation
Run the environment check to verify all dependencies:
```bash
./checkEnvironment.sh
```

## 🛠️ Tools

### 1. buildCheckSummary.py - Quick Rebuild Analysis

**Purpose**: Fast analysis of what will rebuild and why.

**What it does**:
- Runs `ninja -n -d explain` to show rebuild reasons
- Categorizes rebuild causes
- Identifies root cause files triggering cascading rebuilds
- Provides summary statistics

**Use when**:
- You want a quick overview of rebuild reasons
- Checking what changed since last build
- Understanding ninja's rebuild decisions

**Performance**: Very fast (< 1 second)

**Requirements**:
- Python 3.8+
- ninja build system
- colorama (optional)

**Examples**:
```bash
# Basic analysis
./buildCheckSummary.py ../build/release/

# Detailed file list
./buildCheckSummary.py ../build/release/ --detailed

# JSON output
./buildCheckSummary.py ../build/release/ --format json
```

---

### 2. buildCheckImpact.py - Changed Header Impact Analysis

**Purpose**: Shows which headers are causing rebuilds and their impact.

**What it does**:
- Detects changed headers from ninja explain output
- Uses `ninja -t deps` to map header → target dependencies
- Shows how many compilation targets each changed header affects
- Can optionally show all high-impact headers

**Use when**:
- You've made changes and want to know what will rebuild
- Identifying which specific headers have the widest impact
- Quick baseline analysis without heavy dependencies

**Performance**: Very fast (< 1 second)

**Requirements**:
- Python 3.8+
- ninja build system
- colorama (optional)

**Examples**:
```bash
# Show changed headers and their impact
./buildCheckImpact.py ../build/release/

# Show all high-impact headers (not just changed)
./buildCheckImpact.py ../build/release/ --all-headers
```

**Key Metrics**:
- **Impact Count**: Number of targets that depend on each header

---

### 3. buildCheckIncludeChains.py - Cooccurrence Pattern Analysis

**Purpose**: Identifies which headers frequently appear together to find include chains.

**What it does**:
- Builds cooccurrence matrix showing which headers appear together
- For each changed header, shows frequently co-included headers
- Reveals coupling patterns and transitive include relationships
- Helps identify "gateway" headers pulling in dependencies

**Use when**:
- "Why is this header being included everywhere?"
- Finding which parent headers cause transitive includes
- Understanding coupling between seemingly unrelated headers
- Discovering refactoring opportunities

**Performance**: Fast (1-2 seconds)

**Requirements**:
- Python 3.8+
- ninja build system
- colorama (optional)

**Examples**:
```bash
# Show cooccurrence patterns for changed headers
./buildCheckIncludeChains.py ../build/release/

# Only show headers appearing together 10+ times
./buildCheckIncludeChains.py ../build/release/ --threshold 10
```

**Interpretation**:
- High cooccurrence = likely dependency relationship (direct or transitive)
- Use with buildCheckIncludeGraph.py to see actual include relationships

---

### 4. buildCheckIncludeGraph.py - Gateway Header Analysis

**Purpose**: Analyzes actual include graph using clang-scan-deps to find gateway headers.

**What it does**:
- Parses source files with clang-scan-deps for accurate dependencies
- Identifies "gateway headers" that pull in excessive dependencies
- Shows which specific .cpp files will rebuild for each changed header
- Calculates "include cost" metrics
- Provides gateway header rankings

**Use when**:
- "If I change this header, which .cpp files will rebuild?"
- Finding headers with high "include cost"
- Understanding why rebuilds are slow
- Identifying refactoring opportunities to reduce header bloat

**Performance**: Moderate (3-10 seconds, uses all CPU cores)

**Requirements**:
- Python 3.8+
- clang-scan-deps (clang-18, clang-19, or clang-XX)
- networkx: `pip install networkx`
- compile_commands.json (auto-generated)

**Examples**:
```bash
# Analyze changed headers (default)
./buildCheckIncludeGraph.py ../build/release/

# Show top 30 gateway headers regardless of changes
./buildCheckIncludeGraph.py ../build/release/ --full

# Analyze changed headers, show top 20 affected files
./buildCheckIncludeGraph.py ../build/release/ --top 20
```

**Key Metrics**:
- **Include Cost**: Average number of headers pulled in when this header is included
- **Unique Deps**: Total distinct headers that cooccur with this header
- **Usage Count**: Number of source files that include this header
- **Gateway Header**: Header with high include cost

---

### 5. buildCheckDependencyHell.py - Comprehensive Dependency Analysis

**Purpose**: Multi-dimensional analysis of header dependency problems using graph theory.

**What it does**:
- Builds complete transitive dependency graph with NetworkX
- Calculates multiple impact metrics per header:
  - Transitive dependency count
  - Build impact (deps × usage = total compilation cost)
  - Rebuild cost (sources that rebuild if changed)
  - Reverse impact (architectural bottlenecks)
  - Hub headers (highly connected nodes)
  - Maximum chain length (deepest include path)
- Classifies headers by severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MODERATE)
- Provides multiple ranked lists for refactoring priorities

**Use when**:
- "Which headers should I refactor first to improve build times?"
- Finding architectural bottlenecks (hub headers)
- Identifying headers causing most compilation work
- Prioritizing technical debt reduction
- Comprehensive build optimization analysis

**Performance**: Slower but comprehensive (5-10 seconds, uses all CPU cores)

**Requirements**:
- Python 3.8+
- clang-scan-deps (clang-18, clang-19, or clang-XX)
- networkx: `pip install networkx`
- compile_commands.json (auto-generated)

**Examples**:
```bash
# Full analysis with all metrics
./buildCheckDependencyHell.py ../build/release/

# Show top 50 worst offenders
./buildCheckDependencyHell.py ../build/release/ --top 50

# Analyze specific header
./buildCheckDependencyHell.py ../build/release/ --header include/MyClass.hpp
```

**Key Metrics**:
- **Transitive Deps**: Total headers pulled in (direct + indirect)
- **Build Impact**: deps × usage = total header compilations
- **Rebuild Cost**: usage × (1 + dependents) = rebuild expense
- **Reverse Impact**: Number of headers depending on this one
- **Hub Header**: Architectural bottleneck with high reverse impact
- **Max Chain**: Longest include path through header

**Severity Levels**:
- **CRITICAL**: Combined score > 500 (urgent refactoring needed)
- **HIGH**: Combined score 300-500 (should refactor soon)
- **MODERATE**: Combined score < 300 (monitor)

---

### 6. buildCheckDSM.py - Dependency Structure Matrix Analysis

- Detects circular dependencies using strongly connected components
- Computes architectural layers via topological sorting
- Calculates per-header metrics: fan-in, fan-out, stability, coupling
- Identifies headers that violate layered architecture
- Provides compact matrix visualization with color coding
- Exports full matrix to CSV for detailed offline analysis
- **Compares DSM between two builds** (differential analysis)

**Use when**:
- "What's the overall dependency structure of my codebase?"
- "Which headers are in circular dependencies?"
- "Is my architecture properly layered?"
- "What's the safest order to refactor headers?"
- "Which headers have the highest coupling?"
- "Are my module boundaries clean?"
- **"What architectural impact will this change have?"** (use `--compare-with`)
- **"Did my refactoring improve the architecture?"** (use `--compare-with`)

**Performance**: Moderate (3-10 seconds, uses all CPU cores)

**Requirements**:
- Python 3.8+
- clang-scan-deps (clang-18, clang-19, or clang-XX)
- networkx: `pip install networkx`
- compile_commands.json (auto-generated)

**Examples**:
```bash
# Basic DSM analysis
./buildCheckDSM.py ../build/release/

# Show only top 50 most coupled headers
./buildCheckDSM.py ../build/release/ --top 50

# Focus on circular dependencies
./buildCheckDSM.py ../build/release/ --cycles-only

# Show dependency layers
./buildCheckDSM.py ../build/release/ --show-layers

# Export full matrix to CSV
./buildCheckDSM.py ../build/release/ --export matrix.csv

# Filter to specific module
./buildCheckDSM.py ../build/release/ --filter "FslBase/*"

# Cluster by directory
./buildCheckDSM.py ../build/release/ --cluster-by-directory

# Compare two builds (differential analysis)
./buildCheckDSM.py ../build/feature/ --compare-with ../build/main/
```

**Key Metrics**:
- **Fan-out**: Number of headers this header includes
- **Fan-in**: Number of headers that include this header
- **Coupling**: Total dependencies (fan-in + fan-out)
- **Stability**: Fan-out / (Fan-in + Fan-out) — resistance to change
- **Sparsity**: Percentage of empty cells in matrix (higher = better)
- **Module Cohesion**: Intra-module vs inter-module dependencies

**Matrix Visualization**:
```
        0  1  2  3  4  5
●Header1                0  ─  X  ·  ·  ·  · 
 Header2                1  ·  ─  X  ·  ·  · 
●Header3                2  X  X  ─  X  ·  · 
 Header4                3  X  ·  X  ─  X  · 
 Header5                4  X  X  X  X  ─  X 
●Header6                5  X  X  ·  X  X  ─ 

Legend: X = dependency, · = none, ● = in cycle
```

./buildCheckLibraryGraph.py ../build/release/ --libs-only

# Export to GraphViz DOT for visualization
./buildCheckLibraryGraph.py ../build/release/ --export library_graph.dot

# Check for circular library dependencies
./buildCheckLibraryGraph.py ../build/release/ --cycles-only
```

**Key Metrics**:
- **Fan-in**: Number of targets that directly depend on this library
- **Fan-out**: Number of libraries this library directly depends on
- **Transitive dependents**: Total targets affected by changes (build impact)
- **Depth**: Longest dependency path from library to any leaf

**Sample Output**:
```
Top Impactful Libraries:
  1. libFslBase.a
     Fan-in: 95 | Fan-out: 0 | Transitive dependents: 95 | Depth: 0
     
  2. libFslGraphics.a
     Fan-in: 84 | Fan-out: 1 | Transitive dependents: 84 | Depth: 1

BUILD IMPACT ANALYSIS: libFslBase.a
  If you modify libFslBase.a, the following need rebuild:
  - 87 libraries
  - 8 executables
  Total Rebuild Impact: 95 targets (97.9% of build)
```

**Visualization**:
```bash
# Generate GraphViz visualization
./buildCheckLibraryGraph.py ../build/ --export graph.dot
dot -Tpng graph.dot -o graph.png

### Data Flow

1. **Ninja Layer** (buildCheckSummary, buildCheckImpact, buildCheckIncludeChains)
   - Uses ninja's cached build graph
   - Fast but limited to what ninja knows
   - Good for quick checks

2. **Source Analysis Layer** (buildCheckIncludeGraph, buildCheckDependencyHell)
   - Parses actual source files with clang-scan-deps
   - Accurate and comprehensive
   - Slower but more detailed

3. **Git Integration Layer** (buildCheckRippleEffect)
   - Combines git changes with source analysis
   - Shows commit-level impact
   - Requires git repository

---

## 🔧 Common Issues

### "clang-scan-deps not found"

Tools 4, 5, and 6 require clang-scan-deps. Install clang-18 or clang-19:
```bash
sudo apt install clang-19
```

If you have multiple versions, the tools will automatically try:
- `clang-scan-deps-19`
- `clang-scan-deps-18`
- `clang-scan-deps`

### "compile_commands.json not found"

Most tools now auto-generate `compile_commands.json` from your `build.ninja` file.

If you need to generate it manually:
```bash
cd build/
ninja -t compdb > compile_commands.json
```

Or configure CMake to generate it automatically:
```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON ..
```

### "No module named 'networkx'"

Install networkx:
```bash
pip install networkx
```

### "No module named 'git'" or "No module named 'GitPython'"

Install GitPython (required for buildCheckRippleEffect.py):
```bash
pip install GitPython
```

### Slow Performance

For large projects:
- Use quick tools first (buildCheckSummary, buildCheckImpact)
- Run comprehensive tools (buildCheckDependencyHell) periodically
- Results are often cached by clang-scan-deps

---

## 🎯 How to Reduce Recompilation Time

### Understanding the Problem

Excessive recompilation happens when:
- **Headers with broad impact** are frequently modified
- **Deep include chains** cause cascading rebuilds
- **Circular dependencies** force wider-than-necessary rebuilds
- **Monolithic headers** bundle unrelated functionality
- **Missing forward declarations** cause unnecessary includes

### Strategic Workflow for Optimization

#### Phase 1: Identify Root Causes (15 minutes)

1. **Find the biggest problems** with comprehensive analysis:
   ```bash
   ./buildCheckDependencyHell.py ../build/ --top 30
   ```
   **Look for:**
   - Headers with **CRITICAL** severity (score > 500)
   - High **Build Impact** (deps × usage) — these multiply compilation work
   - **Hub Headers** — architectural bottlenecks with many reverse dependencies

2. **Get actionable priorities** with optimization analyzer:
   ```bash
   ./buildCheckOptimize.py ../build/ --top 10
   ```
   **Look for:**
   - Quick wins (high impact, easy implementation)
   - Specific recommendations with ROI scores

3. **Check architectural health** with DSM analysis:
   ```bash
   ./buildCheckDSM.py ../build/ --cycles-only
   ```
   **Look for:**
   - Circular dependency groups
   - Headers with coupling > 50

#### Phase 2: Target High-Impact Headers (Strategic Refactoring)

**Strategy 1: Split Monolithic Headers**

Headers with high usage but many dependencies are prime candidates:
```bash
# Find gateway headers
./buildCheckIncludeGraph.py ../build/ --full
```

**When to split:**
- Include Cost > 50 (pulls in too many headers)
- High usage count (>100 files)
- Multiple unrelated responsibilities

**How to split:**
```cpp
// Before: Engine.hpp (pulls in 150+ headers)
#include "Engine.hpp"

// After: Split into focused headers
#include "Engine_fwd.hpp"      // Forward declarations only
#include "EngineCore.hpp"      // Core functionality
#include "EngineTypes.hpp"     // Type definitions
```

**Expected improvement:** 3-5x reduction in rebuild targets

---

**Strategy 2: Use Forward Declarations**

Replace includes with forward declarations where possible:

```cpp
// ❌ Bad: Pulls in entire class definition
#include "BigClass.hpp"

// ✅ Good: Forward declaration (if pointer/reference only)
class BigClass;
```

**When to use:**
- Function parameters/returns use pointers or references
- Member variables are pointers/references
- Template specializations

**Quick check:** Run this to find high-impact headers:
```bash
./buildCheckImpact.py ../build/ --all-headers
```

**Expected improvement:** 2-10x reduction in transitive includes

---

**Strategy 3: Break Circular Dependencies**

Circular dependencies prevent incremental rebuilds:

```bash
# Find all cycles
./buildCheckDSM.py ../build/
```

**Common solutions:**
1. **Extract interface:** Move shared interface to separate header
2. **Use forward declarations:** Break direct include cycle
3. **Dependency injection:** Pass dependencies rather than including
4. **Move to .cpp:** Move implementations out of headers

**Expected improvement:** Enables parallel builds, reduces cascading rebuilds

---

**Strategy 4: Reduce Include Depth**

Deep include chains amplify rebuild impact:

```bash
# Check for deep chains
./buildCheckDependencyHell.py ../build/ --top 20
```

**Look for:** Headers with Max Chain > 10

**How to reduce:**
- Remove unnecessary transitive includes
- Use forward declarations at intermediate levels
- Flatten include hierarchies where possible

**Expected improvement:** 20-40% reduction in rebuild scope

---

**Strategy 5: Move Implementation to .cpp Files**

Template-heavy headers force everything into headers:

```cpp
// ❌ Bad: Implementation in header
template<typename T>
class Container {
    void complexMethod() {
        // 200 lines of code
    }
};

// ✅ Better: Use PIMPL or explicit instantiation
template<typename T>
class Container {
    void complexMethod();  // Declare only
};
// Define in .cpp with explicit instantiation
```

**Expected improvement:** Reduces header compilation time by 50-80%

---

#### Phase 3: Verify Improvements

After refactoring, measure the impact:

```bash
# Check specific header improvement
./buildCheckIncludeGraph.py ../build/ --header include/MyRefactoredHeader.hpp

# Verify overall improvement
./buildCheckDependencyHell.py ../build/ --top 30

# Compare architectures (if you saved old build)
./buildCheckDSM.py ../build/ --compare-with ../build-old/
```

**Track these metrics:**
- Transitive dependency count (should decrease)
- Build Impact score (should decrease significantly)
- Include Cost (target < 30 for common headers)
- Number of files rebuilt after header change

### Quick Reference: Which Tool for What?

| **Goal** | **Tool** | **What to Look For** |
|----------|----------|---------------------|
| Find worst headers | `buildCheckDependencyHell.py` | CRITICAL severity, high Build Impact |
| Get prioritized action items | `buildCheckOptimize.py` | Quick wins, high priority scores |
| Find headers to split | `buildCheckIncludeGraph.py --full` | High Include Cost (>50) |
| Check for cycles | `buildCheckDSM.py` | Circular dependency groups |
| Quick impact check | `buildCheckImpact.py` | High impact count on changed headers |
| Daily rebuild analysis | `buildCheckSummary.py` | Root cause files, rebuild categories |
| Library-level optimization | `buildCheckLibraryGraph.py` | High transitive dependents |
| Before committing | `buildCheckRippleEffect.py` | Total rebuild impact |

### Pro Tips

1. **Start with low-hanging fruit:**
   - Headers with high impact but few direct dependents
   - Adding forward declarations (low risk, high reward)
   - Removing unused includes

2. **Focus on hot paths:**
   - Headers you modify frequently
   - Headers in critical development areas
   - Base infrastructure headers (used everywhere)

3. **Measure, don't guess:**
   - Run tools before and after refactoring
   - Track improvement metrics
   - Use `--compare-with` to verify architectural changes

4. **Build system optimizations (parallel track):**
   ```bash
   ./buildCheckOptimize.py ../build/ --focus build-system
   ```
   - Enable ccache (5-10x faster rebuilds)
   - Use precompiled headers (PCH)
   - Enable unity builds for stable code
   - Use distributed builds (distcc/sccache)

5. **Target multiplier headers first:**
   - Headers with both high dependency count AND high usage
   - These have exponential impact (deps × usage)
   - Focus on Build Impact score from `buildCheckDependencyHell.py`

6. **Incremental improvement:**
   - Don't try to fix everything at once
   - Pick top 5 headers, refactor, measure, repeat
   - Make refactoring part of regular development

## 📖 Examples

### Example 1: Daily Development Workflow

```bash
# Morning: Check what changed overnight
./buildCheckSummary.py ../build/release/

# After making header changes
./buildCheckImpact.py ../build/release/

# Before committing
./buildCheckRippleEffect.py ../build/release/
```

### Example 2: Investigating Slow Rebuilds

```bash
# Start with optimization analyzer for comprehensive overview
./buildCheckOptimize.py ../build/release/ --quick

# Find worst offenders
./buildCheckDependencyHell.py ../build/release/ --top 20

# Check library-level dependencies
./buildCheckLibraryGraph.py ../build/release/

# See which libraries cause biggest rebuild impact
./buildCheckLibraryGraph.py ../build/release/ --impacted-by libFslBase.a

# Identify gateway headers
./buildCheckIncludeGraph.py ../build/release/ --full

# Understand coupling
./buildCheckIncludeChains.py ../build/release/
```

### Example 3: Refactoring a Header

```bash
# Before: Check current impact
./buildCheckIncludeGraph.py ../build/release/ --header include/MyClass.hpp

# Make changes...

# After: Verify improvement
./buildCheckIncludeGraph.py ../build/release/ --header include/MyClass.hpp
```

### Example 4: Complete Build Optimization Project

```bash
# Week 1: Identify problems
./buildCheckDependencyHell.py ../build/ --top 30 > analysis_week1.txt
./buildCheckOptimize.py ../build/ --report plan.txt

# Week 2-4: Refactor top 10 worst headers
# (Use strategies above)

# Week 5: Measure improvement
./buildCheckDependencyHell.py ../build/ --top 30 > analysis_week5.txt
./buildCheckDSM.py ../build/ --compare-with ../build-backup/

# Compare results
diff analysis_week1.txt analysis_week5.txt
```
